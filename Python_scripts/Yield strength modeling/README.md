## Alloy-718 Yield Strength model

This repository contains the code accompanying the manuscript to estimate the **room-temperature yield strength** of Alloy-718 type nickel superalloys from CALPHAD-derived phase fraction data. 
For each alloy composition, it calculates four strengthening contributions and adds them together:

Details of v1:
$$
\sigma_y = \sqrt{\sigma_{\text{Orowan}}^2 + \sigma_{\text{coh}}^2} + \sigma_{ss} + \sigma_{HP}
$$

| Contribution | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| $\sigma_{\text{Orowan}}$ | Orowan strengthening from γ′ precipitates |
| $\sigma_{\text{coh}}$ | Coherency-strain strengthening from γ″ precipitates |
| $\sigma_{ss}$ | Solid-solution strengthening of the γ matrix |
| $\sigma_{HP}$ | Hall–Petch (grain-boundary) strengthening for a fixed grain size |

The output is a table listing each contribution and the total yield strength
for every composition.
